## Batch Status Lifecycle

Your batch progresses through these states:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingesting">
    Contacts are being added to the database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scheduled">
    Waiting for scheduled start time
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pending">
    Ready to start processing calls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Processing">
    Actively making calls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completed">
    All calls finished
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Check Batch Status

Get real-time status of your batch campaign:

```bash
curl --location 'https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/v1/status/batch?batchId=batch_123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "batchId": "batch_123",
  "calls": [
    {
      "callId": "call_456",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "startTime": "2025-11-15T14:31:02.456Z",
      "phoneNumber": "+15551234567",
      "duration": 62,
      "recordingUrl": "https://..."
    },
    {
      "callId": "call_789",
      "status": "ONGOING",
      "startTime": "2025-11-15T14:32:15.789Z",
      "phoneNumber": "+15557654321"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>
  Live batch status is available for 30 days. After that, use the [Batch Statistics API](/api-reference/endpoint/get-batch-stats).

## Get Batch Statistics

Retrieve high-level statistics for your campaign:

## Key Metrics

### Statistics

| Metric          | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `total`         | Total number of contacts in batch              |
| `processed`     | Number of calls attempted                      |
| `succeeded`     | Number of successful calls                     |
| `failed`        | Number of failed calls                         |
| `pending`       | Number of calls not yet attempted              |
| `percentComplete` | Percentage of batch completed                |
| `successRate`   | Percentage of successful calls                 |

### Performance

| Metric                    | Description                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `callsPerSecond`          | Current call rate                    |

## Call Statuses

Individual calls can have these statuses:

| Status      | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SCHEDULED` | Call is queued and waiting to be initiated    |
| `ONGOING`   | Call is currently in progress                  |
| `COMPLETED` | Call finished successfully                     |
| `MISSED`    | Call was not answered                          |
| `FAILED`    | Call failed due to technical error             |

---

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Poll Regularly

Check batch status every 30-60 seconds during processing:

```javascript
async function monitorBatch(batchId) {
  let status = 'processing';
  
  while (status === 'processing' || status === 'pending') {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/v1/batch/check-status?batchId=${batchId}`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
      }
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    status = data.status;
    
    console.log(`Progress: ${data.statistics.percentComplete}%`);
    
    if (status !== 'completed') {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 30000)); // Wait 30s
    }
  }
  
  console.log('Batch completed!');
}
```

### Use Webhooks

Instead of polling, use webhooks for real-time notifications:

```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "onCallComplete": "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/call-complete",
    "onBatchComplete": "https://api.yourcompany.com/webhooks/batch-complete"
  }
}
```

### Track Key Metrics

Monitor these metrics for campaign health:

- **Success Rate**: Should be > 70%
- **Average Duration**: Indicates conversation quality
- **Calls Per Second**: Verify rate limiting is working
- **Failed Calls**: Investigate if > 20%

---

## Dashboard Monitoring

View batch progress in the Dialgen dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Batches**
2. Click on your batch campaign
3. View real-time statistics and call list
4. Filter calls by status
5. Download reports and transcripts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Low Success Rate

**Problem**: Success rate < 50%

**Solutions**:
- Check phone number quality
- Verify calling hours match timezone
- Review agent prompt effectiveness
- Adjust retry strategy

### Slow Processing

**Problem**: Batch taking longer than expected

**Solutions**:
- Increase `maxCallsPerSecond`
- Check telephony provider limits
- Verify agent is active
- Review system status

### High Failure Rate

**Problem**: Many calls failing

**Solutions**:
- Validate phone number format
- Check API key permissions
- Verify agent configuration
- Review error messages in call details
