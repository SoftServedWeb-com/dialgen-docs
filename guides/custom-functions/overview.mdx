## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Reads Function">
    The AI understands what the function does from its description
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Detects Trigger">
    Based on conversation, AI decides when to call the function
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extracts Parameters">
    AI collects required parameters from the conversation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Executes API Call">
    Dialgen makes the HTTP request to your endpoint
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Returns Response">
    API response feeds back to AI for natural continuation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```json
{
  "name": "check_order_status",
  "description": "Checks the customer's order status. Call this when the customer asks about their order, delivery, or tracking.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "order_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The order number"
      }
    },
    "required": ["order_id"]
  },
  "api_endpoint": "https://api.yourcompany.com/orders/status",
  "http_method": "POST"
}
```

<Tip>
  The description is critical. The AI relies on it to know when to trigger the function.
