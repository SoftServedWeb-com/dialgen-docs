## Call Status Types

Calls progress through these statuses:

| Status      | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SCHEDULED` | Call is queued and waiting to be initiated    |
| `ONGOING`   | Call is currently in progress                  |
| `COMPLETED` | Call finished successfully                     |
| `MISSED`    | Call was not answered                          |
| `FAILED`    | Call failed due to technical error             |

## Checking Call Status

### Live Status (30 Days)

For recent calls, use the live status endpoint:

```bash
curl --location 'https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/v1/status/call?callId=call_123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "callId": "call_123",
  "status": "ONGOING",
  "startTime": "2025-11-15T14:30:01.123Z",
  "phoneNumber": "+15551234567",
  "contactId": "contact_456",
  "batchId": null,
  "error": null,
  "duration": null,
  "recordingUrl": null
}
```

### Persistent Status (After 30 Days)

For older calls, use the persistent status endpoint:

```bash
curl --location 'https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/v1/call/check-status?callId=call_123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<Info>
  Live status is cached for 30 days. After that, use the persistent status endpoint for historical data.

## Monitoring Active Calls

Track ongoing calls in real-time:

```javascript
async function monitorCall(callId) {
  let status = 'ONGOING';
  
  while (status === 'ONGOING' || status === 'SCHEDULED') {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/v1/status/call?callId=${callId}`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
      }
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    status = data.status;
    
    if (data.duration) {
      console.log(`Call duration: ${data.duration}s`);
    }
    
    if (status === 'ONGOING') {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)); // Wait 5s
    }
  }
  
  console.log(`Call ended with status: ${status}`);
