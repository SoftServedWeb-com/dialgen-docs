## What are Duration Limits?

Duration limits set a maximum length (in seconds) for calls. Once reached, the call automatically terminates.

## What Happens at Limit?

When the duration limit is reached:

1. Call terminates immediately
2. Hangup message is played (if configured)
3. Status updates to `COMPLETED`
4. Recording and transcript are saved
5. Metrics are generated
6. Webhooks are triggered

<Warning>
  The call ends immediately when the limit is reached, even mid-sentence. Consider adding a warning before the limit.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Set Realistic Limits

- Analyze average call durations
- Set limits 20-30% above average
- Account for edge cases

### Add Warning Messages

Include a prompt to warn users:

```text
DURATION WARNING:
- When 80% of max duration is reached, say: "We have about 2 minutes left. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- When 95% is reached, say: "We're almost out of time. Let me quickly address your main concern."
```

### Monitor Metrics

Track:
- Calls hitting duration limit
- Average duration by use case
- Correlation with satisfaction scores
