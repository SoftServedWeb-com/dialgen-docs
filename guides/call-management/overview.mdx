## Key Settings

### Duration Limits

Set maximum call length to prevent runaway calls:

```json
{
  "maxCallDuration": 900
}
```

### Silence Detection

Configure silence timeout for automatic hangup:

```json
{
  "silenceTimeout": 12
}
```

### Hangup Message

Customize the closing message:

```json
{
  "hangupMessage": "Thank you for calling, {name}. Have a great day!"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Combine Multiple Methods

Use both duration limits and hangup detection:

- **Duration limits**: Safety net (hard cutoff)
- **Hangup detection**: Natural endings (intelligent)

### Monitor Call Metrics

Track these metrics:
- Average call duration
- Hangup reasons
- Success rate
- User satisfaction

### Test Thoroughly

- Test various conversation flows
- Monitor premature hangups
- Adjust settings based on data
