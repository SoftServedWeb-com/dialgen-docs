### Integration Status

The Genesys Audio Connector integration is currently in **active development and deployment phase**.

### How It Works

When Genesys Cloud initiates an audio stream through the Audio Connector:

1. **Authentication** - Your Genesys environment connects using provided credentials
2. **Agent Routing** - Calls are routed to the specified Dialgen agent
3. **Audio Processing** - The AI agent processes the incoming audio in real-time
4. **Response Streaming** - Processed audio is streamed back to Genesys Cloud

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ConnectorID** | Unique identifier assigned by Genesys for your integration |
| **AgentID** | Your Dialgen agent identifier for call routing |
| **WSS Endpoint** | WebSocket endpoint for real-time audio streaming |
| **API Credentials** | Authentication credentials for secure connection |

### Getting Started

To set up Genesys Audio Connector integration, you'll need:
