title: "API Introduction"
description: "Welcome to the Dialgen API documentation. Our API allows you to programmatically initiate and monitor AI-powered voice calls, either one at a time or in high-volume batches."
---

## API Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the following base URL:

```bash
https://sa.dialgen.ai
```

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using a Bearer Token. Pass your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Response Formats

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. All response bodies are returned in JSON format.

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200 OK` | Request succeeded |
| `202 Accepted` | Request accepted for processing (used for batches) |
| `400 Bad Request` | Missing or invalid fields/parameters |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `402 Payment Required` | Insufficient call minutes/credits |
| `404 Not Found` | The requested resource was not found |
| `409 Conflict` | A call is already in progress for this contact |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | An unexpected server error occurred |

## Best Practices

### Rate Limiting & Throttling

- **Default Rate**: 10 calls per second (adjustable via `maxCallsPerSecond` in batch options).
- **Recommendation**: Start with lower rates (5-10 CPS) and scale up based on your telephony provider's limits.

### Webhooks

For a fully automated workflow, you can provide a webhook URL when creating a batch or initiating a call.

- **Idempotency**: Your webhook endpoints should handle duplicate calls gracefully.
- **Authentication**: Secure your webhook endpoints with authentication tokens.
- **Timeout**: Respond to webhook calls within 5 seconds to avoid retries.
- **Retry Logic**: We retry failed webhook calls up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
