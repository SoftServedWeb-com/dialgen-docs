## Get Started with Dialgen

This guide will help you make your first AI-powered voice call using the Dialgen API.

### Step 1: Obtain Your API Key

All requests to the Dialgen API require authentication with a Bearer Token. You can generate your API key from your Dialgen dashboard. Once generated, keep it secure.

### Step 2: Make Your First Call

Use the `Start a Single Call` endpoint to initiate an outbound call. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key and adjust the `to`, `agentConfigId`, and `userId` fields as necessary.

```bash
curl -X POST https://sa.dialgen.ai/api/private/call/dial \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "to": "+1234567890", 
    "agentConfigId": "agent_123", 
    "userId": "user_789", 
    "callerDetails": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

Upon success, you will receive a `callId` which you can use to monitor the call's status.

### Step 3: Explore the API

Now that you've made your first call, you can explore other functionalities:

*   **Monitor Call Status:** Check the live status of your calls.
*   **Create Batch Campaigns:** Initiate high-volume call campaigns.
*   **Retrieve Call Metrics:** Get detailed analytics and summaries for completed calls.

For more details on these and other endpoints, refer to the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction).
