This changelog provides a detailed overview of updates, new features, improvements, and bug fixes across different versions of Dialgen.

## Version 1.2.0 (December 30, 2025)

### API & Core Updates

*   **API Path Refactoring:** All private endpoints have been moved to the versioned `/api/v1/` path for consistency and future-proofing.
    *   `/api/private/call/dial` → `/api/v1/call/dial`
    *   `/api/private/call/get-metric` → `/api/v1/call/get-metric`
*   **Dual-Layer Status System:** Introduced a high-performance live status system using memory cache (Redis) with a 30-day retention period.
    *   New endpoints for live tracking: `GET /api/v1/status/call` and `GET /api/v1/status/batch`.
*   **New Management Endpoints:**
    *   **List All Batches:** `GET /api/v1/batch/list` – View all campaigns associated with your account.
    *   **Create Call Summary:** `POST /api/v1/call/create-summary` – Manually trigger summary and metric generation.
    *   **Cancel Batch:** `POST /api/v1/batch/cancel` – Stop running or pending campaigns immediately.
    *   **System Health:** `GET /api/v1/health` – Monitor backend connectivity.
*   **Persistent Status:** Added `GET /api/v1/call/check-status` and `GET /api/v1/batch/check-status` for retrieving historical data after the 30-day live cache expires.

### Improvements

*   **Auth Transparency:** Documentation now features highlighted `<Info>` callouts clearly explaining that `userId` should be passed in all requests. Added direct links to the [API Keys dashboard](https://sa.dialgen.ai/api-keys) for easier access.
*   **Documentation Revamp:** Updated all API reference pages to match the new versioned paths, added missing management endpoints, and enhanced monitoring workflows.
